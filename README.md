### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I had trouble implementing flexbox and centering the container using flexbox. But after researching I was able to figure out a way to center the content in the middle of the page. See code below:

```html
<body>
    <main class="main">content<main>
</body>
````
```css
body {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
```


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development
I will continue working on proper alignement of html contents using css. I found out that the biggest challenge I have is making sure that elements take the appropriate space on the page.

I plan to practice using using since I tried implementing it in this project but it was not working out the way I wanted it to be.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) - This is an amazing article that helped me understand how flexbox actually works. I really liked the reverse flex directions and that helped achieved the mobile view of this project.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - This website has a lot of resources that are beneficial to beginners like myselft. It helped understand layouts and the box model.
